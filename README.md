# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview:
A large number of people are expected to retire in the upcoming years. As a result, company is planning to come up with a mentorship program called "silver tsunami" to fill the future opening positions to smooth out the transition of this retirement wave.
Our task is to perform employee research and determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Result:
1. There are 90398 employees in total who are reaching the retirement age. 
2. There will be 29415 senior engineer position, 28254 senior staff position, 14221 engineer position, 12243 staff position, 4502 technique leader, 1761 assistant engineer and 2 manager position available.
3. The breakdown of retiring employees by title is as below:

  4. There are 1549 employees who will be eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? \
My estimate is around 40% given most of the retirees would probably elect flexible retirement; however, depends on the nature of Pewlet Hackard's business, some rules might need to be filled in a greater percentage than other, for instance, the senior engineer, engineer, senior staffs and staffs are the ones essential to the company. Another analysis can be done to calculate the amount of profits each title brings to the company to determine the importance of the titles. (which can also determine the priority of the roles that should be filled first) In additions, some of the administratives or leader can be replaced by an established system and technology. So another analysis can be done to determine how automate the current system is and how much technology is currently implied in the company compare to the industry average. The we can determine the where funds should be allocated and the priority of the roles that should be filled.
40% of the roles need to be filled so as the first generation of silver tsunami mentors retire completely, enough people can take on their roles completely and start mentoring the next generation while keeping the compnay running as normal. 

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? \
Yes, there are 90398 people who are qualified for retirement while there are only 1549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.
total employees: 300024
retiring employees: 90398
mentorship eligible: 1549
Another analysis should eventually be done to see the amount of time an retiring employee takes to mentor a mentee in order to improve the silver tsunami program, in which how many mentors should be assign to one mentee pr vice versa.
